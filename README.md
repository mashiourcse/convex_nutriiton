### Introduction 

This project was part of a submission to the Convex 2024 Hackathon. As food enthusiasts, our goal was to create a search tool for foods based on nutrition parameters. The [website](https://convex-nutriiton.vercel.app/) features a small summary of nutrition benefits (Left Image) as well as the search tool itself (Right Image) with search parameters on the left (for nutrients such as calories, carbs, protein, fiber, etc...) and paginated search results on the right that expand to display a donut chart of the included nutrients for that food.
